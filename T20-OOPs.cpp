// Basic Concepts in Object-Oriented Programming
/*
        #Classes - Basic template for creating objects

        #Objects – Basic run-time entities

        #Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit

        #Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others

        #Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms

        #Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs

        #Message Passing – message (Information) call format
*/
// Benefits of Object-Oriented Programming
/*
        1 - Better code reusability using objects and inheritance
        2 - Principle of data hiding helps build secure systems
        3 - Multiple Objects can co-exist without any interference
        4 - Software complexity can be easily managed
