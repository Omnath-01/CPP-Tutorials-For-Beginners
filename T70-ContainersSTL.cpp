// STL = container + Algo + Iterator
// Containers -> objects which store data
// Algorithms -> set of procedures to process data
// Iterators  -> objects which point to some element in a container.

/*
    Containers are themselves of three types:
    1.Sequence Containers       -> store data in linear fashion  (vector, list, Dequeue)
    2.Associative Containers    -> direct access , store data in tree   (set/Multiset, Map/Multimap)
    3.Derived Containers        -> Real world Modeling (stack, queue, priority queue)

        container = object which store data

/*
When to use which?

Sequence container 
    1.Vector
    - Random Access -> fast
    - Insertion deletion -> slow
    - insertion at the end -> fast
    
    2.List
    - Random access -> slow
    - insertion in middle  -> fast
    - insertion/deletion in end -> fast
    
Associative containets 
    - All operation are fast 
    - except Random access

Derived container
    - depends on Data Structure
